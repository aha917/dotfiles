# .stow-local-ignore file using Perl Regular Expressions.
# This file must be placed inside the package directory (e.g., ~/dotfiles/zsh/).

# 1. Ignore the README.md file in the root of the package.
# This uses the basename matching, which matches the full filename exactly.
# You do not need the ^/ anchor for the basename match.
README\.md

# 2. Re-add the standard ignore for the .git directory.
# Since this must match the directory and everything beneath it,
# it is safest to use a full relative path match (starting with ^/).

# Ignore the .git directory itself (e.g., /.git)
# This prevents Stow from even trying to descend into the directory.
^\/\.git$

# Ignore any file or directory contained within .git (e.g., /.git/config)
# The .* is necessary to match everything after /.git/
^\/\.git\/.*

# 3. Always ignore the ignore file itself.
# Stow usually does this automatically, but it's good practice to ensure.
\.stow\-local\-ignore
